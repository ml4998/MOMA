# MoMA Diversity Research Project

## Overview
This project delves into the representation trends of gender and ethnicity within the art world, with a specific focus on the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA). Utilizing MoMA's extensive online resources and GitHub data, I've conducted thorough research to uncover and understand these patterns.

## Research
The process involved a deep dive into MoMA's digital archives, analyzing available metadata to extract meaningful insights about diversity in their collection.

## Visualization
To bring the trends to light, I employed DataWrapper to create compelling charts, making the data not only accessible but also engaging.

## Conclusions
The visualizations aim to spark conversation and provide a clear perspective on where gender and ethnic representation stands in the art exhibited by MoMA.
